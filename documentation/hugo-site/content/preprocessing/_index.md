# Preprocessing

HiCognition is a visual exploration tool that allows users to explore aggregate behavior of genomic features (see the [concepts section](/docs/concepts) for more detail). This means that this aggregate behavior needs to be computed for a given combination of genomic region and genomic feature. Therefore, HiCognition provides both a job queue that runs the preprocessing (see the [architecture section](/docs/development/development_info/) for more details on this) and a user interface to submit jobs and check their status.
