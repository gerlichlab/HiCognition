# Getting started

This section assumes that you have a HiCognition instance running and your user is set-up in the database. If this is not the case, see the [installation guide](/docs/installation/).

## Get started with example data

Start creating your first [visualizations with our example data](/docs/getting_started/get_started_w_example_data/).

## Add your own data 

Once you have played with our example data, go through the [tutorial](/docs/getting_started/uploading_data) for data addition to add your own datasets to explore. If you need more details about how data managed in HiCognition, go through our [data management guide](/docs/data_management).
