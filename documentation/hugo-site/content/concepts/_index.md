# Concepts

This section discusses why we think HiCognition is a good idea and present the concepts behind the app.

## [Background](/docs/concepts/background/)
This section briefly looks at the existing status quo for genomic data exploration. We briefly introduce the drawbacks of the genomic analysis cycle and postulate how HiCognition aims to bridge the gap.

## [Region-set focus approach](/docs/concepts/region_set_focus/)
This section introduces a core novelty of HiCognition, the region-set focus approach and the key difference of HiCognition to classical genomic browser approaches.

## [Implementation](/docs/concepts/hicognition/)
This section briefly touches on how we solved multiple problems that arise during genomic data exploration.
