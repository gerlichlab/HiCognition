      <description>HiCognition provides a number of concrete preprocessing tasks that are related to the abstract tasks defined in the concepts section. These can be structured as tasks that aggregate genomic features for a given region set or tasks that aggregate collections of features. The preprocessing tasks are related to the types of widgets available for exploration, although some tasks produce data for multiple widgets.
Tasks for single genomic features These tasks aggregate a single genomic feature on a genomic region set and thus make this feature available for exploration.</description>

      <description>HiCognition provides a user interface to submit preprocessing tasks and check their progress.
Submit tasks Depending on whether you want to submit a task for features or collections (see here for more details), click either Preprocess Features or Preprocess Collections in the data management drawer:
This will open the preprocessing dialogue:
Here, you first need to select for which region you want to start preprocessing. To do this, click on the Select region button.</description>
