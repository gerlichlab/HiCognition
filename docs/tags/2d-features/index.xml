      <description>The 2D-average widget can be used to display the average magnitude of a 2D-genomic feature over a specific region set. It is a heatmap representation of the underlying aggregated data.
Suitable data The 2D-average widget is suitable for any genomic dataset that can be represented using a multiresolution cooler file. This is primarily suitable for Hi-C data but can also include other data sets that assign a value to a tuple of genomic coordinates.</description>

      <description>The 2D-feature embedding widget can be used to display the distribution of genomic regions regarding a 2D-genomic feature. It represents a 2-dimensional embedding of the genomic regions as a heatmap of points.
Suitable data The 2D-feature embedding widget is suitable for any genomic dataset that can be represented using a multiresolution cooler file. This is mostly suitable for Hi-C data but can include other data sets that assign a value to a tuple of genomic coordinates.</description>
